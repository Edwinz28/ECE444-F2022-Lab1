Edwin (Tianyi) Zhang. Link to EP Repo: https://github.com/Edwinz28/ECE444-F2022-EP
Quick note: Activities 6 and later were done before 4 and 5 because I couldn't find a partner in time so I proceeded to skip those sections (later realizing activity 5 you do not need a partner). Thats why the commit history shows A8 before A4
